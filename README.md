# turtle-race

The game is a simple race. When it is started it will ask the use to "bet" and enter which color (each turtle is one fo the 6 raqinbow colors) turtle they think will win. After the user enters the bet, the game will populate the 6 turtles and they will start to move and one of them will win. It will then tell the user if they one or not.

What is used: Python and Turtle

To play this game the code would have to be forked or copied. Then run the code with 

`python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

place the bet when it opens and watch it run.

*I think it would work on tkinter 8.5 but to not get the warning using whatever distribution method of python you want just make sure it has tkinter updated with it*

**Personal highlights:**
It was a cute little game that let me stretch my python brain muscles again as I working with that and javascript.

**Struggles while building:**
Getting turtle to work, I kept getting a depreciation warning., Looking it up took me down a lot routes that I intrigued to learn more about (virtual enviroments being one of them) but It seemed to fix itself when I downloaded python from website, the brewed python I had used the computers tkinter and the one from the website included the newer version.

**What I learned:**
That not all distributions of python are the same, but also while I haven't figure out virtual enviroments enough to comfortably used them. I learned a lot more about how people feel about them and that they can help with the different distributions but I still don't get all the different ways to use them or which to use.
